# Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-with-Python

## What is Image Classification?
Image classification is the Computer Vision task through which we can categorise and label the collection of pixels based on specific rules and recognize certain objects within that image.
In this project we will perfrom single and multi-Label Classfication using Deep Learning Models like ResNet and AlexNet. In the result, We will feed the input images to the models and let the model predict the animals present in the images and we will print out the class and Name of animals with the percentage certainity.
